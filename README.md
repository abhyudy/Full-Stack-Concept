04 -- class = It is a blue print
Give out the structure of something which reuseable multiple places.
-- constructors = A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword. The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object properties.
-- static method = It can be call without object also.
-- JavaScript Promises used to simplify managing multiple asynchronous operations, preventing callback hell and unmanageable code. They represent future values, associating handlers with eventual success or failure, resembling synchronous methods by postponing value delivery until later.

// Promise = Promise is a class, which call async function more readable.
// Closures = A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function and the inner function retains access to the outer function's variables.
